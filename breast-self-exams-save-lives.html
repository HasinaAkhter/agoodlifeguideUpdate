        <p class="text-justify">
	      Breast self-exams can save lives if it is done thoroughly and carefully as  does your doctor. As you know, breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women in USA. It also affects men but rarely. Study says, in 2015, there are >2.8 million women in USA with a history of breast cancer including those currently being treated as well as those who have finished treatment. The earlier it is detected the better.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify"> 
         Breast self-exams is a way to check your breasts for changes (such as lumps or thickenings). Most breast lumps (a compact mass of a substance, especially one without a definite or regular shape) are detected in this way and the fact is, 80% of the lumps are not cancerous. Lumps may appear due to hormonal changes during your menstrual cycle.		 
		</p> 
		<p class="text-justify">
	      Most importantly, breast self-exams can save lives only if you properly know your breasts  by regular self-exams and visit your doctor upon noticing anything unusual. If the lumps are cancerous, the earlier you go for treatment the better.
	    </p>
	    <h2>Breast self- exams: when to do?</h2>
		<p class="text-justify">
		  Just after your period each month, when breasts are not tender or swollen. Do it every month. Most importantly, learn it from your doctor first and then do it as below:
		</p>
	   
	    <ul class="text-justify">

         <li><u>Step 1</u>: Lie down and put a pillow under your right shoulder. Place your right arm behind your head</li>
		 <li><u>Step 2</u>: Use the finger pads of your three middle fingers on your left hand to feel for lumps or thickening in your right breast. Your finger pads are the top third of each finger</li>
		 <li><u>Step 3</u>: Press firmly enough to know how your breast feels. Try to copy the way your doctor uses the finger pads during the breast exam. A firm ridge in the lower curve of each breast is normal</li>
		 <li><u>Step 4</u>: Move around the breast in a set way. You can choose either the circle or the up and down movement of your finger pads throughout your breast</li>
		 <li><u>Step 5</u>: Similarly, examine your left breast</li>
		 <li><u>Step 6</u>: Repeat the exam of both breasts while standing, with one arm behind your head. 
		     The upright position makes it easier to check the upper and outer part of breasts (toward your armpit). This standing part of examination you can do while taking shower as some breast changes can be felt more easily when your skin is wet and soapy</li>
         
	</ul>
	
    <p class="text-justify"><strong>Breast self-exams can save lives:  See your doctor if you discover any of the following changes  in either of the breasts:</strong></p>

    <p>
        <ul class="text-justify">
          <li>A lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm</li>
          <li>A change in the size, shape, or contour of the breast</li>
          <li>A mass or lump, which may feel as small as a pea</li>
		  <li>A marble-like area under the skin</li>
		  <li>A change in the feel or appearance of the skin on the breast or nipple<br> (dimpled, puckered, scaly, or inflamed)</li>
          <li>Bloody or clear fluid discharge from the nipples</li>
         <li>Redness of the skin on the breast or nipple</li>
        </ul>
	</p>
		 
        <p class="text-justify">
         However, there could be some other signs on the breasts such as skin dimpling that may left unnoticed. Lisa Royle  (42-year-old Manchester woman ) who had to go through mastectomy and subsequent chemotherapy warned us at facebook with this alarming issue in her very touchy words:
		</p>
		<p class="lead">Very subtle dimples underneath that could easily be missed when we’re all rushing round getting ready in a morning. Please take time to look at your boobs. It could save your life.</p>
	<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/breast-cancer-selfie-facebook-photo-warns-women-what-to-look-for/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to reference news report">CBC news report</a> about Lisa Royle’s  facebook selfie.</p>  
	<p class="text-justify">Therefore, breast self-exams can save lives if you are very through and watchful as instructed by your doctor. You need to be very careful for the slightest little changes on your breasts and consult with your doctor.</p>
	<p><strong>It is always recommended that you should visit your doctor for clinical breast exam every one to three years in your 20s and 30s and every year starting at your 40s. </strong></p>
