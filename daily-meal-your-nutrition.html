	      According to CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) about 600,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year–that’s 1 in every 4 deaths. Coronary heart disease is the most common type of heart disease, killing nearly 380,000 people annually. Lowering your blood pressure and cholesterol will reduce your risk of dying of heart disease. Moreover, a  healthy diet that is low in salt; low in cholesterol; and rich in omega-3 fats, fresh fruits and vegetables combined with a healthy lifestyle can make a huge difference(see also <a href="tips-to-keep-healthy-heart.html"> Tips to keep a healthy heart </a>) .</p>

        <p class="text-justify">
		 <strong>Oatmeal</strong> is also a good source of dietary fiber and thus important for maintaining  our bowels health and movement. It is rich in beta-glucan (soluble fiber) which  when combined with low-fat diet is good for our heart. Eating this whole grain  (minimally processed) food for breakfast supplies us with carbohydrate, protein  and fat needed to fuel up our day.

         <u>Aim for 1 cup cooked oatmeal per day.</u>
		
		<p class="text-justify"> 
		<strong>Spinach</strong> is an excellent source of dietary fiber that helps in bowel movement. Fresh, frozen, steamed, or quickly boiled spinach has a high nutritional value. It is a rich source of vitamins (A, K and C) and minerals (magnesium, manganese, folate and iron).
		<u>Aim for 1/2 cup cooked spinach per day.</u>
		</p>
		 
		<p class="text-justify">
		<strong>Tomatoes</strong> rich in lycopene (the carotene ) and thus beneficial for lowering the risk of bladder, prostate, skin, and pancreatic cancers and coronary heart disease. These are excellent source of potassium, a mineral that plays a role in our every heartbeat as well as essential for our muscle movement, nerve function and blood filtration process of kidney.
		<u>Aim for about eight red cherry tomatoes or a glass of tomato juice.</u> To maximize the health properties of tomatoes, don’t peel them.
		</p>
		 
		<p class="text-justify">
		<strong>Carrots</strong> are rich in carotenoids, fat-soluble compounds associated with a reduction in a wide range of cancers, as well as reduced risk and severity of inflammatory conditions such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.
		<u>Aim for 1/2 cup a day.</u> Don’t chop up your carrots. Boiling them whole is recommended to increase their anti-cancer benefits.
		</p>
		
		<p class="text-justify"> 
		
		<strong>Blueberries</strong> rich in fiber and vitamins (A and C) boost cardiovascular health. These are excellent source of antioxidants and can fight against diabetes, age-related dementia and cancer.
		<u>Aim for 1 cup fresh or 1/2 cup dried blueberries a day.</u>
		</p>
		<p class="text-justify"> 
		
		<strong>Grapes</strong> are good sources of carbohydrate, vitamins (C, A and K, and several B vitamins, including folate, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and B6), and dietary fiber. The skins of purple grapes contain resveratrol (a polyphenolic compound) that has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and thus good for our health.
		<u>Aim for 1/2 cup purple grapes a day.</u>
		</p>
		
		<p class="text-justify"> 
		
		<strong>Walnuts</strong> are rich source of omega-3 fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids) that provide protection against heart disease and possibly stroke. Omega-3 fatty acids for numerous normal body functions, such as controlling blood clotting and building cell membranes in the brain.
		<u>Aim for 1 ounce, or 7 nuts daily (as snacks)</u> instead of other less healthy ones i.e. chips, sugar enriched cookies as 1 ounce of walnuts a day could add 10 pounds or more in a year if you don’t cut back on something else. So cut back other less healthy snacks.
		</p>
		<p class="text-justify"> 
		
		<strong>Yoghurt</strong>, a milk product  is a good source of protein, calcium, vitamins (B2, B12 and D) and minerals (potassium, and magnesium). Individuals who cannot eat dairy products (Lactose intolerant people) may tolerate yoghurts as lactose of milk is either fermented to lactic acid or broken down to sugars by bacteria present in yoghurt. It is also good for bowels movement. Most importantly many yoghurts are made using Probiotics (active and good bacteria) that provide the healthy amount of good bacteria needed in the digestive tract of our body. Thus yoghurts help boost our immune system and may fight against cancer.
		<u>Aim for 1 cup of yoghurt (make sure its label says “live and active cultures”) daily.</u>
