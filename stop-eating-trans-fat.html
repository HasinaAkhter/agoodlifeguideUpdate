        <p class="text-justify">
	      Stop eating trans fat.  Is it a simple task to do? Not really unless you know why you are doing it.  

         Recent breakthrough CNN news about trans-fat: FDA (the Food & Drug Administration) says:</p>
          <p class="lead">Trans-fat is not generally recognized as safe for use in human food.</i></q></p>
          <p class="text-justify"> FDA will halt the use of trans-fat in American diet within the next 3 years.</p>
         <p class="text-justify">Trans fats are produced in an industrial process by adding hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them more solid and spreadable. It is also known as partially hydrogenated oils. Several food manufacturers add trans fats to give foods a desirable and stable flavor as well as longer shelf-life. These partially hydrogenated oils can be used to deep-fry foods many times and thus cost-effective. Small amounts of trans fats are naturally present in some meat and dairy products, including beef, lamb and butterfat. However these naturally occurring trans fat are not that much damaging to your health compared to man made trans-fat/partially hydrogenated oils.</p>		 
		 <p><strong>Fried foods like French fries, doughnuts, and baked food items such as cakes, frozen pies, cookies, frozen pizza, crackers as well as coffee creamers, ready to use frosting and stick margarine are made with trans fats. Consumption of these fats can raise your LDL cholesterol levels and reduce your good cholesterols (HDL) thus make you more susceptible to heart disease and stroke.</strong><br> AHA (the American Heart  Association) recommends to reduce as much as possible your daily intake of trans fat to remain healthy and active. Thus the most recent crackdown by FDA on trans-fat is to prevent more premature death.</p>
	     <p class="text-justify">
		   According to CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) avoiding artificial trans fat could prevent annually 10,000-20,000 heart attacks as well as 3000-7000 coronary heart disease related deaths in the US.
		 </p>
	
	<p class="text-justify">Therefore, stop eating trans fat as soon as you can. <br>Follow these 5 simple and easy changes in your daily life to make the difference:
	    <ul class="text-justify">

         <li><strong>Always</strong> check the ingredients on the label of the foods for trans-fat or partially hydrogenated oils. 
		     Products can be listed as 0 grams trans fat having 0 to 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving. Experts say even 0.5 grams amount is unsafe.</li>
         <li><strong>Bake</strong> foods such as cakes, muffins, pie, cookies at home if possible to  avoid the restaurant bought version of them insanely loaded with trans-fats.</li>
         <li><strong>Use</strong> instead olive oil, canola, safflower, sunflower oils which are not hydrogenated.</li>
         <li><strong>Make</strong> a habit of cooking lean meats without adding these fats.</li>
         <li><strong>Swap</strong> butter with soft margarine but avoid harder stick forms of margarine. Look for “zero grams trans fat” on the label and no hydrogenated oils in the ingredients list.</li>
        </ul>
	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">
      Denmark, Switzerland, and Canada as well as several US states such as California, New York City, Baltimore, and Montgomery County have reduced or restricted the use of trans fats in food service establishments.</p>
	</p> 
	<p class="text-justify">  
	  Do you know that the favorite food chain McDonald’s had stopped using trans-fat more than a decade ago?
      Do you know Chick-fil-A removed all artificial trans fat from its menu in 2008?  
	</p>

     <p class="text-justify">
	  Yes they did and  FDA steps in to remove the use of trans-fat from American’s foods within the next 3 years.

      Stop eating trans fat right now and keep a better metabolic health!
